            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a 24-year-old with a passion for learning and a drive to push myself. When I'm not working as an
                IT support engineer, you can find me hitting the gym â€“ I recently started training in powerlifting,
                which is a great challenge.

                Beyond the gym, I'm a self-learner who thrives on acquiring new skills and hobbies. This website is
                a testament to that! I'm currently working on developing my programming skills with the goal of
                transitioning from IT support to a software development role.

                Whether it's coding a new application, mastering a new recipe, or picking up a new instrument, I'm
                always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and abilities. Stay tuned as I document my
                experiences and learnings here!</p>
